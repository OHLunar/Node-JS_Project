# Node-JS_Project
You will need to download the couple of npm like:
dotenv | ejs | express | mysql2 | sequelize | nodemon (Optional)


My project contains the following:

Create user accounts:
Create new accounts by filling out a simple form. Just enter the person's first name, last name, email and phone number and the user will be added to the system.

View all user accounts:
See all registered users in one convenient list. You will find their names, email and phone numbers displayed neatly in a table.

Delete user accounts:
If it happens to be necessary to remove a user from the system, just click the "delete" button next to his name, and he will be removed quickly.

My website is built using Node.js and some useful tools like Express, EJS, Sequelize, MySQL2 and Dotenv. These tools helped me to streamline the project process and manage the data with the database.
